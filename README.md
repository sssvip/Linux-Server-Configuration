## Step by Step
  1.Launch your Virtual Machine with your Udacity account and log in. 

  You can manage your virtual server at: https://www.udacity.com/account#!/development_environment (you must a member in udacity nano degree)
  2.Create a new user named grader and grant this user sudo permissions.

  3.Update all currently installed packages.

  4.Configure the local timezone to UTC.

  It is very easy to inadvertently lock yourself out of the server. If this happens you will have to delete your server and start from scratch. Complete these steps before proceeding, and double check every command before running it!
  5.Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200

  6.Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123)

  7.Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi application

  8.Install and configure PostgreSQL:

  9.Do not allow remote connections

  10.Create a new user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database

  11.Install git, clone and set up your Catalog App project (from your GitHub repository from earlier in the Nanodegree program) so that 
  it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. Remember to set this up appropriately so that your .git 
  directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!

  12.Your Amazon EC2 Instance's public URL will look something like this: http://ec2-XX-XX-XXX-XXX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ where the X's are replaced with your instance's IP address. You can use this url when configuring third party authentication. Please note the the IP address part of the AWS URL uses dashes, not dots.
